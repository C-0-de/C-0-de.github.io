<h1>Sessions Available</h1>

<h2>Teaching Style</h2>

<p>I can provide sessions that are flexible to your schedule and can help you learn a variety of computing languages, including:
   <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Unity Gaming Development</li>
    <li>Git</li>
    </ul> 
</p><p>
During tutorials, I work with students to create simple projects that help them understand programming. My focus is to get students to start coding as soon as possible and build up their confidence to be able to build their own unique projects. My one-on-one tutorials works matches the style and pace of each studentâ€™s learning preferences.

<h2>What To Expect</h2>
<p>
If you are a beginner, classes will focus on the fundamentals of programming and gaining the experience you need to build your own projects.
</p><p>
I will teach basic use of git based source control and IDE setup. All projects worked on during sessions will be released open source on git, with the GNU AGPLv3 licence. This means others can use and learn from code created during sessions.
</p><p>
I do not teach to an exam or offer an accreditation - my goal is to help you develop key industry skills and start working on a portfolio. If you are seeking employment within a coding-relating field, your portfolio will demonstrate to future employers that  you know and can use the language. I also encourage students to make use of resources, such as Hackerrank and Edabit (link).
</p>
<h2>Software used</h2>
<p>
During the first session, I will get you set up with:
<ul>
    <li>Discord for screen sharing and VOIP chat</li>
    <li>Visual Studio</li>
    <li>The relevant programming language compiler and tools</li>
    <li>git source control</li>
</ul>    
</p>
