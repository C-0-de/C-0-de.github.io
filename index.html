    I am a Programing Tutor with flexible session times to fit around you. Capable of tutoring multiple languages including: Java, c#, Unity Game Development, python, git.
</p>
<p>
    During tutorials I work with students to create simple projects that help them understand programming. my focus is in getting my students to start coding and build up there confidence to create and complete projects on there own. my one on one tutorials
    work at the pace of the students and can be student lead improving engagement.

<h2>What To Expect:</h2>
<p>Tutoring programming for beginners, classes designed to ground students and help them work gain experience and work on their own projects, I will teach basic use of git based source control and IDE setup. all projects worked on during sessions will be
    released open source on git, with the GNU AGPLv3 licence, this means others can use and learn from code created during sessions.
</p>
<p>I do not teach to an exam nor do I offer an accreditation, that said my goal is to teach industry skills with a focus on leaning a skill. I Encourage Students to make use of resources such as <a href="hackerrank.com">Hackerrank</a> as well as help them
