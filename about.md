## Professional background
I have worked as a programmer for a security company that develops privileged access management and task automation software. while there I worked in python maintaining existing applications and developed code fixes and enhancements.

in the past I have worked for The London Marathon as a Finish Build Team Member. hauling the different fences around and on occasion dealing with the general public. the exacting schedules and site plans for the London Marathon are impressive it really was a marvel what got done in such a short time.

## Past And Future Projects
### Mob book
a number of years ago I designed a collaborative story-making website based in Python, using flask as the framework and sqlite to store user data https://github.com/megonemad1/MobBook it was an early project I created. 

it's a website designed to let users create the next sentence in a story. it had some problems to overcome, primarily i didn't want to have a authentication system but i did want a rating system, this lead to creating a combination of mitigations to prevent repeat rating of story parts.

Currently designing a story framework for game development, capable of creating
dynamic game states. I have delivered a presentation on this game to a local
technology meetup group called Geek Night where I detailed my development
process.

another project based I created on Linux operating system using vim and the upstart functionality of Ubuntu, I created scripts to aid me in time management as well as setting up a server which pulls logs
from the family's smart boiler to help my dad understand why we have no hot water.

## Hobbies and Interests
### Game Development
I enjoy flexing my programming and design skills by creating games in my spare time. I participated in
several Southampton Game Jams and in 2017 my team won the Popular Game Award for our entry, The Chinese Room. I enjoyed working on both code and art design during the game jam.

### Canal Boating
I am a qualified skipper having achieved the Certificate in Community Boat Management (CCBM). This qualification is about managing a boat crew and members of the public on a trip boat, including taking charge during an emergency and the preparation required for such events.

### Blacksmithing
I've recently taken up blacksmithing and have built my own workshop. My most recent projects were a steel bracelet and a two handed Damascus steel cake knife for my sisters' wedding. I have spent a couple of months helping out at a local blacksmiths where I learnt how to weld and other metal fabrication techniques.
